<p><strong>I</strong></p>
<p>I first started getting into politics in 9th grade, around the 2016 election. My friends, Jack and Knox, were also very interested into politics, and they are the reason why I love politics.</p>
<p>I supported Trump, and still do, he was a much better pick to me than Hillary Clinton, he knew how to run a business and the USA needed to be ran like one to be financially healed. I also was happy that he wanted to strengthen our border, because we do not know who these people are that are illegally coming into our country. And most of the illegal immigrants have the audacity to come to the United States of America to flee from their country, then completely shit on US tradition and wave their home countries flag willy-nilly, right after fleeing from it!</p>

<p>I honestly do not know why I am currently writing this, it is really just because I am trying to get better with code and I could not thing of anything to do, so I decided I would write. I am certainely <strong>not </strong>a good writer, but I think it is fun. My interests/hobbies are four wheeling, coding, trucks, remote-control, and more. I also play video games but only select ones. For example, I love Grand Theft Auto 5, Rocket League, and TC Rainbow Six Siege, thats about it. The main reason I ever turn my Xbox One on is really just to talk to my friends, because they are on all the time. When my friends aren't playing video games, we are all hanging out. I have a pretty large friend group that is always growing. Matthew, Dalton, Andrew, Anthony S, Blayne, Anthony H, Ben, Jackson, Sam, Jason, Ryan, and a couple more kids. My friend group is <strong>not</strong> perfect, we always have arguements, and sometimes fights, but in the long run, we all know that we have eachothers backs. </p>

<p>Where I live, the hangout spot is at a McDonalds. Yep, you read that right, the fast food place. I think the reason why it's the hangout spot is because the parking lot is pretty big, and part of it is tucked behind trees and stuff. I mean, going to McDonald's to hangout is an every day thing, and it's not just my friend groups hangout spot, it's basically my entire high school. If you pull up to that McDonalds on almost any day of the week, you will see kids in the parking lot hanging out. </p>
<p><strong>IV</strong></p>
<p>When it's just my friends and I, we hangout anywhere, and something we like doing often is burnouts and donuts. While I don't have a truck myself, Blayne and Jason do. We always jam pack into their trucks and start doing donuts and burnouts. Now it's not legal, but atleast we aren't doing drugs or something. A few other things we do when we are bored is go to Walmart. For whatever reason, Walmart is an extremely fun place to run around and mess around. We also go to Matthew's neighborhood to play football. We go to his house because there is a church with a field two buildings down from his house. His neighborhood is also a fishing village, so when we go there, we sometimes go fishing as well.</p>
